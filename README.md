# ad_likeness_dataset
The dataset includes 25 Bangladeshi advertisement clips that are annotated by raters. These clips are publicly available on YouTube and televised on over 20 TV channels in Bangladesh. The advertisement clips are classiﬁed into ﬁve different categories - Entertaining, Creative, Emotional, Humorous, and Miscellaneous, each having unique characteristics. 
A video is categorized based on the overall impression obtained from the raters. Each category has a number of videos ranging from 4 to 6. Frame-rate of the videos varies between 25 fps and 30 fps. 
The total number of frames in each category ranges from 5850 to 9550, with a duration of 224 seconds to 370 seconds, respectively. The resolution of a frame of these videos is 1280×720. 
The folder `ADVERTISEMENT CLIPS' contains 25 Bangladeshi advertisement video clips.
The folder `Reaction Video' has 20 sub-folders. Each subfolder is titled `Person N,' where `N' indicates the annotator serial number.
Each sub-folder contains 25 reaction videos against advertisement video clips.

For example, `person20_25.mp4' indicates that this is the facial response of the 20th annotator against the 25th advertisement clip. `annotation.xlsx' contains both ground truth and individual frame-by-frame annotations of raters against each video.
